0. I tried to not only make damageable props that looks nice, but also tried to put
myself into creators shoes. One important decision that I came up with is not only make
objects that explode or getting destroyed, but also leaving their damaged versions. It is helpful
if you want to make interactable and damageable environment that is not empty after objects
are destroyed. That's why I made few different versions of some objects, so you can choose
what fits best for your game. Most of objects were built by myself so they are unique

All props are in the client context and have only netwroked invisible hitbox to make sure
your game has best performance. Also all effects that's played on death have LifeSpan of 
5 seconds, so they won't be stacking forever ruining game performance as far as game progresses
and more effects being played.

1. You can split this CC project into 4 parts

a) Windows with breakeable glass.

I Added breakeable glass to all windows in Core. It is
small detail that makes any game feel better and
more realistic. You can find windows you need easy by the their original
name and use in your games. Different windows have different broken glass settings such as
particle size and density to perfectly match for your needs.

b) Sci-Fi props. Sci-Fi is one of Core Creators favorite topic, so I decided to make
useful things you might use in your games. Variety of items and their versions will help
you to fullfill all your needs and create enjoyable environment for your players.

c) Fuel station props. Not much to say, you can use it almost in any game, especially
after Traffic Jam necessity in Fuel station props are high.

d) Christmas props and others. I tried to make variety of props that you can use in any project,
they don't have anything in common except the fact that if you making a Core game, you'll find
something that will fit in your project.

2. Simply drag object in the scene and you are ready to go. All props in the hierarchy sorted
in the same order they are on the scene, so you don't have to jump around looking for object
you need. You can change HitPoints of any damageable object in the hierarchy by clicking
on it's name and setting MaxHitPoints and StartHitpoints

3. Main advantage of this props is that they are not only destructable, but also leaving
damaged versions of it, so world don't feels empty after damage being implied. You can
also use only damaged version of the objects if it fits your game. All objects are organized
in folders and it is very easy to find what you need. Parts of props also all organized into
folders, so there is no problem to find some small part that you need to edit if you want to.
Also some objects have permament effect after being destroyed such as Capsule will have Fire effect and sound
of fire same as Old radar will have electrical sparks effects and sound.
